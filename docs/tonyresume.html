     For me to really like a book, it's got to feel real: dialogue needs to sound authentic, characters need to well developed & a mix of good & bad, as real people are. Likewise, I don't want the ending to be predictable, nor all happy or all tragic. I also prefer fairly clean language & no graphic sex scenes.

     In his prime, Edward Bloom was an extraordinary man. He could outrun anybody. He never missed a day of school. He saved lives and tamed giants. Animals loved him, people loved him, women loved him. He knew more jokes than any man alive. At least that¬ís what he told his son, William. But now Edward Bloom is dying, and William wants desperately to know the truth about his elusive father¬óthis indefatigable teller of tall tales¬óbefore it¬ís too late. So, using the few facts he knows, William re-creates Edward¬ís life in a series of legends and myths, through which he begins to understand his father¬ís great feats, and his great failings.

        The Secrets of Inchon</a>
        If Korea is America's forgotten war, Eugene Franklin Clark is certainly one of that war's least-known heroes. The Secrets of Inchon is his first-person account--written in 1953 and long forgotten in a safety deposit box--of his terrifying fortnight on a small island in North Korean-occupied Inchon harbor. Douglas MacArthur's planned invasion was as fraught with peril as it was daring.</li>

        The Funnies</a>
        There are many fine touches in Lennon's tale: the sad, chain-smoking brother Pierce, who takes pills to get rid of the "extra people"; their town's annual FunnyFest, in which visitors can buy Timburgers and Coca-Cola √† la Carl; Brad Wurster, the grim-faced artist who teaches Tim how to draw ("'Family Funnies' sounded, on his tongue, like a fraternal order of concentration camp doctors"). But in the end, it's the funnies themselves that stay with you. As Tim works obsessively on the strip, its stylized visual language and bland gags eventually become an object of genuine, capital-M Mystery--weirdly compelling and symbolically fraught. In its own, stubbornly shallow way, the strip is a document of their family, or at least of their father's self-loathing. "Cartoon characters are deformed freaks we are convinced are like us," Wurster tells his reluctant pupil, but in Lennon's hands, it's the American family that looks more freakish than ever.</li>

        What I found was a book of contridiction. A young man, abandoned at birth by a family loathe to have another son, he seeks the love he's missing because he believes that nature made us love. He sees love as unattainable as power in a world where both are worshipped. He "loves", almost worshipping, a French woman married to a man traumatized by war,with children she sees as sickly, almost to death. Her physical rejection of him is reborn to the power he is given by who she is and who she knows as she and her children are mentally abused by the man she was married to, an ineffectual bully that she filters towards his tenants and society, while his maudlin attitude drives everyone away.</li>

            At age 13, Bobbie leaves the violent, abusive home where he was raised, and this book details his following year. He has an older girlfriend, carries a gun, takes drugs, and is on an ever-tightening spiral to hell, his crimes escalating until they include murder. The plot, which highlights Bobbie's increasing dependence on the highs of violence, is not pointless but instead emphasizes a frightening reality. For Bobbie, read Little. He's been there, and his graphic story is written with an immediacy and realism that will make normal thinking people cringe and parents anxious to protect their children from the harshness in which some youth live.

            In 1820, the Nantucket whaleship Essex was rammed by an angry sperm whale thousands of miles from home in the South Pacific. The Essex sank, leaving twenty crew members drifting in three small open boats for ninety days. Through drastic measures, eight men survived to reveal this astonishing tale. The Narrative of the Wreck of the Whaleship Essex, by Owen Chase, has long been the essential account of the Essex‚Äôs doomed voyage. But in 1980, a new account of the disaster was discovered, penned late in life by Thomas Nickerson, who had been the fifteen-year-old cabin boy of the ship. This discovery has vastly expanded and clarified the history of an event as grandiose in its time as the Titanic. </li>

Inseparable as youngsters, in their teens they grew apart. Esther played femme fatale and got all the guys; Gemma played underdog and got stuck in the role of wallflower. What's worse, Esther went on to university, whereas Gemma deliberately failed her exams, missing an opportunity to show off her biggest asset, her brains. So there is plenty of emotional baggage to check when Esther and Gemma, now in their early 20s, travel to India for what is supposed to be an extraordinary adventure that will renew their somewhat tattered bond.</li>

            The author of Falstaff, Merlin and The Memoirs of Lord Byron takes on WS himself, producing a lively, bawdy gallimaufry of anecdotes, facts and fictions that inevitably will be compared to Anthony Burgess's Nothing Like the Sun. The conceit is that "Robert Reynolds alias Pickleherring," a comic actor now an octogenarian, met Shakespeare when the playwright was 32 and Pickleherring 13. Now Pickleherring lives in a London attic, above a whorehouse that itself is above a bakery, and sets out to tell the "country history" of WS. He tucks in all the anecdotes that make gossips and scholars swoon, for example the possibility that Queen Elizabeth I was Shakespeare's mother, that the Vicar of Stratford, not a humble butcher and tanner, was Shakespeare's father.</li>

            There was no question that Toni Beauchamp's mother, Elena, could work magic. She used magic the way other people use credit cards, ringing up huge bills to get the things she wanted. But the debts had to be paid off sooner or later, and in this case payment meant letting one of the six lesser gods known as Riders take possession of her body. When Elena died, Toni and her sister Candy thought the magic died with her. But their mother left them a gift that couldn't be refused, and now Toni finds herself endowed with the same powers she once despised in her mother. And if that wasn't enough, her mother also left behind emotional, financial, and familial disasters that she and Candy must find some way to cope with. </li>
